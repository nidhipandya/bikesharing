The above data is for peak hours for bike trips during the month of August. This data will help us get a better idea of how many bikes we might need and which parts of the day we'll need the most bikes. If we need to do maintenance on a bike, we should do when the bike are in minimum usage. By looking the Graph between 3a.m to 4 a.m is good time for maintance and between 4 p.m to 7 p.m is peak hour.
